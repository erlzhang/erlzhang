### Hi there 👋

I'm a front-end web developer lived in Beijing, China. 

I'm currently working on web-based annotation tools development with Canvas and WebGL.

I’m passionate about programming, design and user experience. I like building minimal websites using static site generators. I have made several minimal WordPress themes, Jekyll themes and Jekyll plugins. You can find them from my Github.

I like writing. If you happen to be familiar with Chinese, you can find more articles and novels from my Chinese blog.
